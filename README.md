Key Features:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilizes the Scikit-learn Breast Cancer dataset, featuring 30 medical attributes for malignant and benign tumor classification.

Dimensionality Reduction: Implements Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce 30 high-dimensional features into two-dimensional visualizations for cluster analysis.

Data Engineering: Includes robust preprocessing workflows using StandardScaler to normalize features for model stability.

Deep Learning: Developed with PyTorch for Google Colab (GPU-accelerated), featuring training loops that monitor validation accuracy and loss over multiple epochs.

Visualizations: Includes automated plotting of training curves and PCA scatter plots to evaluate model performance and data structure.
